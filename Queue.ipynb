    "## Overview:\n",
    "A queue, in general, refers to an ordered collection of items. When new items are added, it occurs at one end called \"rear\". When existing items are removed, on the other hand, it is at the other end called the \"front.\" Items are added to the \"rear\" as it makes itself toward the \"front\" as the item in front of it is removed. The newest item that is added to queue has to wait until it reaches the \"front\" of the queue. This is also known as \"first come, first served\" or FIFO (first-in, first-out). For example, a real-life scenario is a printer queue in which a printer releases print jobs in a queue fashion. In other words, as one print job is finished, it is essentially is removed so the print job behind it will be released. \n",

    "This is a successful implementation of a Queue utlizing a class Queue and functions that operate in the interactive shell in Python or terminal. As stated previously, a printer queue is essentially how this data algorithm works. As an item is added or removed, a item goes to \"rear\" of the queue or removed from the \"front\" of the queue. This data type might be utilized when you want to talk to a customer service representative online. There is a waiting period to talk until a representative is available. Once a person is finished, the person is \"removed\" and you are in \"front\" of the queue as the next person to talk. "
